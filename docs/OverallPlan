Project
	-> Project Streams & Goals
		-> Objectives
		-> User Stories
			-> Requirements / Code

Project can have many goals and streams (many to many)
A user story should reside within a project stream and can be linked to one or more goals.
A user story makes up requirements for a coded implementation.

This is only intended to take care of the software creation side of the project, there may be streams that do not require any software - they can be noted, but no stories / code will be linked to them (up for grabs).


Project can be created by anyone - who then becomes the owner.
Project owner can add other users to the project.
All events in the system will be captured in an 'event store', this should effectively allow for us to export the project to another piece of software that does a similar thing.
